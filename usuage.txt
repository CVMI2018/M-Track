**GUI DESCRIPTION**
 ***Load Video***       = Load video file for grooming analysis (.AVI, .MOV, .MPEG, .MP4, .SEQ, .TIFF)
 ***Save Path***        = Set the path to the directory where you want to save the output files. M-Track exits if no directory is selected
 ***Start CAM***        = Start Continuously Adaptive Meanshift algorithm
 ***Exit***             = Close M-Track GUI
 ***Draw Cage***        = Draw the perimeter of the bounding box in which you want M-track to perform the tracking analysis
 ***Draw LF ROIs***     = Draw the perimeter of the box representing the region of interest (ROI) where M-Track tracks the position of the left foot, for each mouse being analyzed
 ***Draw RF ROIs***     = Draw the perimeter of the box representing the ROI for the right foot, for each mouse being analyzed. To draw the right foot ROI, click the left mouse button on one corner or the ROI, drag the mouse and release the left button once the ROI has the desired size.
 ***Detect Mice***      = Allows the user to set the HSV mask to detect the mouse body
 ***Detect LF***        = Allows the user to set the HSV mask to detect the mouse left foot
 ***Detect RF***        = Allows the user to set the HSV mask to detect the mouse right foot
 ***# Mice   ***        = Number of mice to be tracked (1, 2, 4)
 ***Execute***          = Start the analysis
 ***Pause***            = Pause the analysis
 ***Viewing Mode***     = Allows the user to view the video in its acquisition format (Original), in the HSV color space (HSV) or in three distinct mask modes that allow the user to set the upper and lower limits to detect the body (Body Color Mask), left foot  (Left Foot Color Mask) and right foot (Right Foot Color Mask)
 ***L Hue***            = Sets the lower limit for hue
 ***L Sat***            = Sets the lower limit for saturation
 ***L Val***            = Sets the lower limit for value
 ***U Hue***            = Sets the upper limit for hue
 ***U Sat***            = Sets the upper limit for saturation
 ***U Val***            = Sets the upper limit for value
 ***Dilation***         = Enlarges the size of the body and feet color masks
 ***Min Box Size***     = Minimum number of pixels contained in the left/right foot ROI
 ***Collision Detect*** = This option allows M-track to detect only one body color mask per mouse
 ***Noise Reduction***  = Removes noise in the image by using a non-local means denoising algorithm, using the selected denoise value
 ***Denoise Val***      = Regulates the strength of the noise reduction
 ***Zoom***             = Zoom within the cage area

**VIDEO ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS**
 1.  Press ***Load Video*** to upload the video file to be analyzed. M-Track analyzes 8-bit .AVI, .MOV, .MPEG, .MP4, .SEQ, .TIFF video files
 2.  Press ***Save Path*** to select the directory where M-Track saves the output data. By default, M-Track saves the output file in the same folder containing the video file to be analyzed
 3.  Press ***# Mice*** to select the number of mice to be analyzed (1, 2, 4)
 4.  Press ***Draw Cage*** to draw the perimeter of the enclosure where M-Track performs the tracking analysis. If the analysis is  performed on only one mouse, M-Track expects the perimeter of the enclosure to be shaped as a box. This box is drawn with three consecutive click-and-release steps using the left button of the computer mouse. If the analysis is  performed on more than one mouse (i.e. 2 or 4), M-Track allows the user to first draw the perimeter of the bounding box as described above. Next, a pop-up message requests the user to ***Now draw a line for each dividing wall***. Only one line needs to be drawn when analyzing two mice, whereas two lines need to be drawn when analyzing four mice. The lines are drawn by clicking and dragging the left mouse button.
 5.  Press ***Draw LF ROIs*** to draw a box representing the ROI where M-Track tracks the position of the left foot. To draw the left foot ROI, click the left mouse button on one corner or the ROI, drag the mouse and release the left button once the ROI has the desired size.
 6.  Press ***Draw RF ROIs*** to draw a box representing the ROI where M-Track tracks the position of the right foot. To draw the right foot ROI, click the left mouse button on one corner or the ROI, drag the mouse and release the left button once the ROI has the desired size.
 7.  In ***Viewing Mode***, select the option ***Body Color Mask*** and set the upper (U) and lower (L) limits for the HSV settings to isolate the mouse body area from that of the recording enclosure. The ***Dilation*** button allows to enlarge the area of the Body Color Mask. The ***Min Box Size*** can be used to set a lower threshold for the number of pixels within the Body Color Mask ROI. This is useful to reduce tracking errors when other pixels, in the enclosure, have the same HSV settings as the fur.
 8.  In ***Viewing Mode***, select the option ***LF Color Mask*** and set the upper (U) and lower (L) limits for the HSV settings to isolate the left foot area. The ***Dilation*** button allows to enlarge the selected foot area. The ***Min Box Size*** can be used to set a lower threshold to the number of pixels within the left foot ROI. This is useful to reduce tracking errors when other pixels, in the enclosure, have the same HSV settings as the left foot.
 9.  In ***Viewing Mode***, select the option ***RF Color Mask*** and set the upper (U) and lower (L) limits for the HSV settings to isolate the right foot area. The ***Dilation*** button allows to enlarge the selected foot area. The ***Min Box Size*** can be used to set a lower threshold to the number of pixels within the right foot ROI. This is useful to reduce tracking errors when other pixels, in the enclosure, have the same HSV settings as the right foot.
 10. In ***Viewing Mode***, select the option ***Original***. Press ***Detect Mouse***, ***Detect LF***, ***Detect RF*** to check that all HSV settings are optimally tailored for accurate grooming analysis by tracking the position of the mouse body, left and right foot, respectively.
 11. As a final step, press ***Execute*** to run the M-Track analysis and ***Pause*** to pause the M-track analysis and reset the detection parameters if needed.
 12. The ***Start CAM*** option allows the user to initiate the Continuously Adaptive Meanshift algorithm, through which M-Track rotates and rescales the LF and RF ROIs to locate the position of the mice LFs and RFs.
 13. Press ***Exit*** to close M-Track
